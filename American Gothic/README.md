American Gothic is one of the most recognized paintings of the 20th century, and its meaning has been the subject of various interpretations and parodies. Grant Wood, the artist behind the work, drew inspiration from his background, surroundings, history, architecture, and imagination. This essay examines how Woodâ€™s portrayal of the rural midwestern family in American Gothic is ultimately seen as a symbol of resilience and strength for Americans post Great Depression and in turn symbolises the American spirit.
