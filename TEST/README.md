==Winslow Homer=={Q344838} is known for his dramatic paintings of sailors and fisherman at sea. This essay explores how Homer depicts the labor of working on the water through a range of examples. 

#The Herring Net

In ==*The Herring Net*=={Q20273499} Winslow Homer adds a number of details that create an ominous feeling, in which the fishermen seem to be battling a heavy catch alone in a heavy sea that about to become stormy. Occupational therapists have even used this painting to examine the professional dangers of fishing.[^1] 

#Sounding Titles

Homer often titled his works to reference sounds at sea, such as the blast of a foghorn in ==*The Fog Warning*=={Q12162390} at left. In the work ==*Eight Bells*=={Q5348954} on the right, two officers are using sextants to determine when it is noon, which would be announced to the ship by the ringing of eight bells. Noon is when the sun is at its highest point in the sky, and knowing exactly when it is noon in their present location enables the ship's crew to determine their latitude, or their position on the earth relative to the equator. The ringing of eight bells on a ship also marked the changing of the watch, as each watch was four hours long and each half-hour of the watch would be marked by a single additional bell. By showing the daily ritual of determining noon and titling his work with a reference to the four-hour routine of changing the watch, Homer emphasizes the regular rhythms of work at sea.

Kathleen Foster's *Shipwreck* is one of many works of scholarship that addresses Homer's fascination with work at sea. This 1923 catalogue of Homer's work includes many of the artist's seascapes, showing how well known he was for this material early on. As H. Barbara Weinberg points out in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's [Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History]( https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/homr/hd_homr.htm) Homer was fascinated with not just the men who worked at sea but also the women who worked on shore "whom he depicted hauling and cleaning fish, mending nets, and, most poignantly, standing at the water’s edge, awaiting the return of their men."[^2] Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Johns, have seen Homer's seascapes as a window into the artist's psyche.[^3]

#Popular Media
Homer's love of the sea has even been covered by the mainstream media, such as in this segment from PBS NewsHour.
